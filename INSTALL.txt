INSTALL


This is short installation guide.

==== Installation ====

The installation process, as with most MyBB plugins, is simple and (unfortunately) manual.

The file, located in the package in the "/clicky/src/" folder", should be copied, via FTP or whatever method is available, to the MyBB source code tree, specifically to the "/inc/plugins/" folder.

That's it.


==== Activation ====

After copying files the plugin must be activated.

This is done by going to the Admin menu Configuration / Plugins, locating the plugin in the table and clicking the "Activate" button/link.

That's it.

If you don't see the plugin listed there that means there is something wrong with the installation.


==== Configuration ====

After activation the plugin must be configured.

This is done by going to the Admin menu Configuration / Settings, locating the plugin in the table and clicking its button/link. This shows the parameters that the plugin needs in order to work correctly.

At the moment there is only one parameter and that is the "Site ID". This is an identifier provided by Clicky and should look like "111111" or similar.


==== Testing ====

After going through all the previous steps go to the board home page and refresh it to make sure new HTML is generated. View the source code of that page - Ctrl-U on Firefox/Windows or right-click menu "View Page Source". 

Near bottom of the page you should see something like this ...

<script type="text/javascript">
var clicky_site_ids = clicky_site_ids || [];
clicky_site_ids.push(XXXXXX);
(function() {
  var s = document.createElement('script');
  s.type = 'text/javascript';
  s.async = true;
  s.src = '//static.getclicky.com/js';
  ( document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] ).appendChild( s );
})();
</script>
<noscript><p><img alt="Clicky" width="1" height="1" src="//in.getclicky.com/XXXXXXns.gif" /></p></noscript>

That means the plugin works and is inserting the necessary code.

If for some reason you don't see this that means something went wrong with the previous steps.
